# Smart Home Thermostat Using SwiftUI

Creating an Smart Home Thermostat using SwiftUI. This application will give the user the ability to change the temperature from "Cooling" to "Heating" depending on which direction you move the thermometer knob. This will then show the user what temperature it is currently being changed to. Also displayed on the interface is two cards that show the "Inside Humidity" & "Outside Temperature".
